## Summary

This package renders the plan-mode status chip: when the host-computed projection's effective target is plan mode, the composer shows a warn-colored "Plan ×" button that turns plan mode off; otherwise the seat stays empty. Plan mode itself — the `/plan` command, the committed `plan/mode` state, the projection unit, and the policy section — belongs to `dsh-plan-handoff`; this package only renders the projection and sends what a user could equally type. The model exits plan mode through the stable `exit_plan_mode` tool; its plan review uses the composed Web question channel. It also selects the execution session a clear plan handoff opens.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside `ui-conversation` and `dsh-plan-handoff`; the chip then occupies the composer's plan seat to the right of the access-mode control whenever plan mode is active. Enter plan mode through the `/plan` command path — choose Plan from the composer's `+` Command menu or type `/plan` — and turn it off with the chip.

### What the chip shows

While the effective target is plan mode, the seat renders the warn-colored "Plan ×" status button, which executes `/plan off`. Otherwise the seat stays empty: a host without plan mode, or a Draft with no session, shows nothing. While plan mode is the effective target, the composer textarea's placeholder switches to the plan-task hint — "describe your task to generate plan" — unless the owning surface supplies its own placeholder.

### Failures

Admission failures (`matched: false`, business errors, transport faults) surface as an inline error and the chip stays until the projection confirms the exit.

### Following a clear plan handoff

`Approve and execute` runs the approved plan in a fresh sibling session: `dsh-plan-handoff` creates it, logs `plan/handoff` on the planning session, and steers the plan into the child. This package watches the Session on screen for that event and selects the execution session as soon as the Session list carries it, so the ordering of the event against the child's list arrival does not matter. A log that already contains a handoff never moves the page — only a live event on the Session on screen commits the navigation — and the user navigating away after the event does not cancel the pending selection.

An execution session that has not started its turn yet is blank, so its sidebar row reads as the provisional New Session entry until the steered turn lands.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The chip occupies the conversation-declared `conversation.input.plan` single seat; the node half is an empty apply (the roster row). Reads ride the generic projection pair through the standard-kit `useProjection`: the effective target is `pending ? !active : active` — a folded host value, not client optimism, so an arriving frame corrects the chip either way. The seat's injected face carries one verb, `exitPlanMode`, which executes `/plan off` through `ctx.remote.commands.execute` and maps admission failures to an inline error line. The placeholder and hint text live in ui-conversation's `conversation` locale namespace and are shared verbatim with the claimed `/plan` command hint. The accessible description is "Plan mode on, press to turn off".

The follow rides the same apply: `followPlanHandoff(ctx.sessions)` subscribes to the selected Session's `binding().eventSource`, commits the child id a live `plan/handoff` append names, and opens it on the list notification that carries the row — `list.ids` gates the `open`, because the service throws for an unknown id. Changing the selection rebinds the subscription, so a handoff logged on a Session that is not on screen is ignored, while an already-committed child survives a later switch until it lands in the list.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the plan surface is not enough. They move from the chip to the plan-mode domain and the composer shell.

- [dsh-plan-handoff](../../plan/plan-handoff/README.md) — owns plan mode, the `/plan` command, the projection, and the policy section.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares the composer's `conversation.input.plan` seat and the placeholder locale keys.
- [Tool catalog](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-plan-handoff) — the `exit_plan_mode` tool schema the model uses to leave plan mode.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the `/plan off` command line the chip dispatches: `dsh-plan-handoff` owns the model-visible policy section, the exit-tool schema, and the logged state that line drives.

#### KV Cache effect

Entering or leaving plan mode changes the active `plan:policy` system-prompt section and therefore the request prefix; the chip itself adds no prompt content.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current plan chip. They are current package constraints, not a plan-mode comparison or a task backlog.

- **Plan mode is guidance, not an execution sandbox** — deployments that require enforced read-only planning must compose the independent sandbox and approval policies.
- **The chip belongs to the default composer** — a pending whole-composer interaction such as plan review temporarily replaces the InputBar and its chip.
- **No inactive plan control** — entry uses the shared Command source; a session with the capability but inactive mode shows no plan affordance in the tool row.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Plan state and boundary ownership are audited by dsh-plan-handoff, while the control is a slot effect whose declaration, registration, and teardown are exercised by this package.
