## Summary

Choose Agent presets and the new-task default in Web, read each mode's description and configuration, and choose the preset for a fresh session created by an approved plan. A preset is fixed when its session is created; changing the default does not alter running sessions. Authoring is guided to Creator mode.

## Use this package

Settings shows the built-in and custom card groups with default highlighting and card-body selection; a group without presets is omitted, except the custom group, which keeps its Creator entry on screen. Every card offers “View configuration”, which opens the preset's declared plugin list as read-only YAML in the Loader's own dialect (`!!js` conditions included); a failed preset stays readable because its diagnostic points into that YAML. Escape closes only the viewer and returns focus to its card; leaving Settings clears the viewer, and a late read does not reopen it. The page edits nothing: the Creator entry starts a Creator-mode task that authors or overrides a preset as a bundle, offered while the `cordis` preset is on the roster and a conversation flow exists.

Coding Tools in General Settings decide whether a mode can be chosen at all: with them off the new-session picker disappears and the cards refuse selection, while the saved default keeps composing new tasks. Choosing a healthy default also synchronizes the blank session on the current new-task surface. Creator starts a new task using the `cordis` preset.

Known shipped presets offer mode details and usage examples in a read-only dialog. Its tabs preserve each page's scroll position; closing returns focus to its opening action. Help does not change the new-task default. The default badge replaces the card's group badge, and the preset id appears beside the title.

### The plan-review choice

An approved plan that opens a fresh execution session composes a preset, and the plan-review card asks for it in its fresh-session step. That control stages the new-session pick until approval creates the receiving session. It renders nothing when the deployment composes no presets or the planning session joined none.

### The conversational entry

When the roster carries the self-referential `cordis` preset, its Creator entry starts a new session using that preset.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

`agentPresets/list` supplies the roster and marks the current default, and `agentPresets/read` one declaration's YAML for the viewer; default changes write the `agent-preset-registry` settings namespace. The picker, blank-session synchronization and read-only session label use recorded preset identities. Connection resets and settings updates refresh the roster.

## Further Exploration

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the selected preset, whose plugins own model-visible capabilities.

#### KV Cache effect

Selection changes affect only later tasks; existing plugins and prompts remain unchanged.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- Web creates and edits no preset: the configuration viewer is read-only, and a bundle installed through Creator mode declares a new preset or overrides a shipped one by row id, replacing its complete child list.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published; the Host registry owns state, and component tests cover client presentation and selection.
